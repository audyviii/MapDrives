# MapDrives
small automation idea for current helpdesk tasks


Concept: Automate one of the many processes needed for building/imaging new laptops. Within the environment, there is an opportunity to make the process of mapping drives down
         to two inputs and the task is completed. Though this may seem like a minute automation, reducing the amount of clicks to map one, if not many, network drives to a couple
         of keyboard strokes can help focus on the next task sooner, and more efficiently


Known bug(s):

- Error handling needed in multiple outcomes. [Currently fixing]
- Limitation on the ability to add/remove all drives listed simultaneously. 
- Adding feature within a while-True condition for reuse after more than one, individual one is needed (but not all are needed)
